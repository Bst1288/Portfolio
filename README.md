# Portfolio
Hello, my name is Sirapassorn. I am a detail-oriented person with a strong sense of responsibility and the ability to work well under pressure. I believe these qualities make me well-suited for a career in Software Testing, which requires precision, critical thinking, and a high level of accountability.

I graduated with a Bachelor's degree in Computer Engineering from King Mongkut's Institute of Technology Ladkrabang (KMITL). During my studies, I developed a software testing skill through courses such as Software Development Process, Database Systems, and more. I also participated in a website development project where I was responsible for designing test cases and verifying the functionality of the system to ensure its accuracy and reliability.

Although I do not yet have direct work experience in Software Testing, I have proactively enhanced my knowledge through self-study. I have practiced writing test cases and explored tools such as Jira and Google Sheets to manage bugs and test results. I am committed to continuously improving my skills in this field and have set a clear goal to become a mid-level software tester within the next two years.
